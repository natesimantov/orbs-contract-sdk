# Gamma

> Version v0.5.1 (beta) 
>betaLocal Orbs blockchain instance for developers

&nbsp;
## Overview

Gamma is a local Orbs blockchain instance for smart contract developers. With Gamma, you can easily and efficiently deploy, run and test smart contracts designed for the Orbs network. Gamma runs an in-memory virtual chain on top of an Orbs blockchain with several nodes on your local machine. 

The `gamma-cli` command line tool helps developers interact with the Gamma server instance running on their machine. 

&nbsp;
## Installation for Mac

1. Install the command line tool using [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running in terminal:

    ```
    brew install orbs-network/devtools/gamma-cli
    ```

    > Verify with `gamma-cli version`, you should see the current version. 

2. Make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) is installed on your machine.

3. Start Gamma server by running in terminal:

    ```
    gamma-cli start-local
    ```
    
    > Stop with `gamma-cli stop-local` when finished

Options:

  -code string
    	source file for the smart contract being deployed, normally .go or .js file (default "contract.go")
  -env string
    	environment from orbs-gamma-config.json containing server connection details (default "local")
  -i string

  -txid string
    	TxId of a previously sent transaction, given in the response of send-tx
  -wait
    	wait until Gamma server is ready and listening

Multiple environments (eg. local and testnet) can be defined in orbs-gamma-config.json configuration file.

## Workflow

#### Starting and stopping the server

Start the server with `gamma-cli start-local` and stop it with `gamma-cli stop-local`. The server runs locally and listens on port 8080 by default, although a custom port can be given as argument.

The local server instance is a full blockchain network made from several nodes which communicate using an actual consensus protocol. 

When transactions are not sent, the nodes will keep closing empty blocks. It is therefore recommended to stop the server when it's not needed with the `gamma-cli stop-local` command.

#### Test keys and accounts

When first launching Gamma server a batch of 10 testing accounts (public keys, private keys and addresses) will automatically be created and saved under `orbs-test-keys.json` in the local directory. Please note that these keys are for testing only and should not be used in secure production environments.

To replace the keys with a new batch of 10 accounts run `gamma-cli gen-test-keys` in terminal.

Every account in the file is given an ID. The default IDs are `user1` to `user10`. You can change the IDs by editing the file directly.

#### Deploying smart contracts

To deploy a smart contract run the command `gamma-cli deploy` and provide the contract name. You will also need to provide the source code for the contract.

Contracts are immutable. If you want to update the code for a contract, deploy it again under a different name.

Note that Gamma server is an in-memory blockchain. When you stop the instance with `gamma-cli stop-local` all contracts will disappear.

#### Sending transactions and calling contracts

Send transactions to contracts (write operations) by running `gamma-cli send-tx` and call contracts (read operations) by running `gamma-cli read`.

Both commands rely on an input JSON file which contains the actual details of the smart contract call:

```json
{
  "ContractName": "CounterExample",
  "MethodName": "add",
  "Arguments": [
    {
      "Type": "uint64",
      "Value": "25"
    }
  ]
}
``` 

The contract name should be the name chosen during deployment of the contract with `gamma-cli deploy`. The method name should be one of the exported methods found in the contract source code.

The array of arguments should be given according to the declaration of the method in contract source code. The following primitive argument types are supported:

* `uint32` - Number with 32 bit precision. Matches the `uint32` type in go contracts and `number` type in js contracts. Provided in the JSON as a string of a decimal number.

* `uint64` - Number with 64 bit precision. Matches the `uint64` type in go contracts and `BigInt` type in js contracts. Provided in the JSON as a string of a decimal number.

* `string` - String. Matches the `string` type in go contracts and `string` type in js contracts. Provided in the JSON as a UTF8 string.

* `bytes` - An array of bytes (blob). Matches the `[]byte` type in go contracts and `Uint8Array` type in js contracts. Provided in the JSON as a hex string.

In addition to these primitives, `gamma-cli` supports several aliases for convenience:

* `gamma:keys-file-address` - An account address by ID. The value should be an account ID from `orbs-test-keys.json`. An alias for the type `bytes` which means it matches the `[]byte` type in go contracts and `Uint8Array` type in js contracts. Used to pass the account address in raw form.

#### Working with multiple environments

The command line tool supports multiple environments such as local and test net. To configure multiple environments create a file named `orbs-gamma-config.json` in the local directory, with the following format:

```json
{
  "Environments": {
    "local": {
      "VirtualChain": 42,
      "Endpoints": ["localhost"]
    },
    "testnet1": {
      "VirtualChain": 90043,
      "Endpoints": ["http://192.168.1.1", "http://192.168.2.2:8080"]
    },
    "testnet2": {
      "VirtualChain": 3007,
      "Endpoints": ["http://10.1.1.122", "https://node-example.com", "http://another.io:8081"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can choose the active environment by passing the `-env` command line argument to every command. For example:

```
gamma-cli send-tx -i transfer.json -signer user1 -env testnet2
```

If a config file does not exist, the default environment is `local` with virtual chain `42` and the endpoint `localhost`.

## Building from source

All developer tools (Gamma server and `gamma-cli`) are provided as binaries for convenience only. If you're interested in building the tools from source, find Gamma server as part of the node core in https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-network-go and `gamma-cli` as part of the client SDK in https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-client-sdk-go.
